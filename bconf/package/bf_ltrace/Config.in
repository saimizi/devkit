	  Debugging program which runs a specified command until it exits.
	  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records
	  the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed
	  process and the signals received by that process.

	  Note:
	    The Latest stable version is 0.7.3 which does NOT support aarch64.
	    This bf package is a git clone one (0.7.91) maybe buggy.
